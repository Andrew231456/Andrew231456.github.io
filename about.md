I am currently a freshman at the time of writing this and already my life has been interesting so far.

## Some Other Information
I mainly am a team leader and self taught myself majority of the stuff I know besides college stuff.
I put a lot of effort in the things I am most passionate about so if its programming related you bet that I will be trying my hardest on it!
